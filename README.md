The final project was conclude on second term from course Web Development II.

## Design
I used Adobe XD to create the high fidelity wireframe and also prototype and performed the low fidelity prototype drawing.

## Challenges
I found many challenges when programming the site, mainly with the responsiveness and the hamburger style navigation menu.

## Solutions
I looked for solutions on platforms such as W3 School and Bootstrap, as well as on YouTube about hamburger menu.
